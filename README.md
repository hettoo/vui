# VUI

Java UI library inspired by Vim.

## Why?

Humans usually have no more than two hands. A keyboard requires two hands.
A mouse requires another one. As it is tiresome to move your hand all the time
and typing using the mouse is very hard, the mouse should simply be removed.

## Bugs

* The current way of rendering doesn't seem to with Windows. However, as Windows
  is just about as obsolete as the mouse, this isn't really a bug.
